# WW test assignment

I've made most assignment requirements. You also can review my testing skills [here](https://github.com/morewings/cra-template-quickstart-redux) and [here](https://github.com/morewings/cra-template-no-redux).

I used Tailwind and shadcn for rapid prototyping. Here is my own components library: [Koval UI](https://koval.support/).

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Node** >= 18.x.
2. Install **pnpm**. E.g. `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate`.

### Review

```shell script
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
